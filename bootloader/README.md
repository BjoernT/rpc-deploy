# rpc-deploy bootloader

This directory contains the scripts to generate an iPXE bootloader
used for initial setup of the deployment system when getting
starting out with a fresh environment.

Given the location of your deployment.yml, it will setup your deployment
server, give you the option to setup remote access to the deployment
server, and other initial tools to make the deployment of your RPC
environment easier.
